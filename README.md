# Music-installer

Check out my [blog](https://risiz.onrender.com/programs/music-installer/) if you want to know how this works.

This program is a simple script which used `youtube-dl` as it's core.

`youtube-dl` used in this program isn't a python moduld.
It is a package, which you need to have installed in your system.

It is basically because, I think executing command, is far better than writting a custome installer.
It may be slow, but get's the job done.

In the `urls.dow` file the info should be placed in this style:
```
>
<creator's name>
<title>
<url>
[<featured artists>]
>
```

eg:
